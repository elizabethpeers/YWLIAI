Young Women Leaders in AI Camp 2019

Group C 

This is our business pitch that was presetned on the last day of the camp. 




________THE CODE_______

There is the deep learning code that runs at 85% accuarcy during train/test phase. 
During interference the algorithm ran at 99% accuracy. 

To run the code you will need to run "Rex the robot.ipynb", and to change the directory to your local folder that you have saved the folder.


To do so copy and paste your directory in this space: 

SOURCE_PATH = r"C:\Users\lizzi\OneDrive\UNI\2019\thesis\Machine Learning Course\YWLAI\rex"

SOURCE_PATH = r"__your directory__"

The folder "rex-images" contains 2 folders "train" and "test", these are the images that the code learns from.
The folder "rex-models" contains the output weight models from the code as it learns. It will only save the best accuracy model after each iteration.





_______THE PRESENTATION_______
